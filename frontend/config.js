  "I had been preparing for the presentation all week. Every evening after work I rehearsed the slides out loud, adjusting the timing so I wouldn’t rush the final section. The conference room was already set up when I arrived that morning, the chairs arranged neatly in rows and the projector humming softly against the white wall. A few colleagues filtered in, placing their notebooks on the table and offering brief nods. I checked my notes once more, feeling confident that everything was finally in place. This was the opportunity I had been working toward, and the room seemed ready for it. I stepped forward and connected my laptop to the projector. The screen flickered, then froze on a distorted version of my desktop. I tried again, unplugging and reconnecting the cable, but the display remained unresponsive. A message appeared across the screen indicating that the file could not be opened. I navigated through the folders, searching for the backup copy I was sure I had saved, only to find the directory empty. The room, which had felt structured and prepared moments earlier, now held a quiet stillness that seemed heavier than before. I stood facing the blank projection, aware that the plan I had built over the past week no longer matched the situation in front of me. The outline in my head felt incomplete without the slides guiding it. I cleared my throat and began speaking without them, rearranging the order of points as I went, shifting from the sequence I had practiced to something improvised but still workable.",
  "The beach felt exactly like the break we had imagined. The sun settled warmly on my face, and the water stretched out in clear, steady blue. We sat close together on the sand, watching the small boats glide past in slow, quiet lines. Everything about the afternoon suggested calm—just the rhythm of waves and the gentle drift of sails across the horizon. Then the air shifted. A sharp, sour smell rolled toward us before I even saw where it was coming from. A plume of dark smoke rose beyond the dunes, thickening as it drifted directly over our spot. The sand near our towels felt damp and gritty, clinging to my shoes in oily clumps. A nearby engine revved louder than before, its noise cutting across the steady sound of the water. The peaceful scene I had settled into no longer fit what was unfolding around us. For a moment, it seemed as though the entire afternoon had tilted away from what we expected it to be. But you reached into the bag and handed me a container of fresh strawberries, nudging my shoulder and pointing toward the water. A pair of dolphins surfaced near the boats, their bodies arching briefly through the waves before disappearing again. We stood to watch them, and gradually the smoke became something distant rather than overwhelming. The engine noise faded into the background, and the boats resumed their quiet drift across the horizon. The beach was no longer exactly what I had pictured at the start, but it settled into something steady again, just in a different way."
